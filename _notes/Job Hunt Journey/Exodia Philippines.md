I'm excited to start my career where I can grow, and Exodia's global projects and mentorship-based approach are exactly the kind of environment I want to thrive in.

_Sample Answer:_  
From my academic background, I understand that data analysis involves collecting, organizing, and interpreting data to uncover trends and support decision-making.

**4. What tools or platforms have you used for handling or analyzing data?**

_Sample Answer:_  
So far, I've used Google Sheets, MySQL, and basic dashboard components in React. I’ve also documented and tested data validation logic during my internship. I haven’t worked with CRM platforms yet, but I’m confident I can learn quickly since I enjoy working with structured data.

**5. Are you comfortable working with repetitive data tasks?**

_Sample Answer:_  
Yes, especially when I understand the purpose behind them. I find satisfaction in keeping data clean and accurate because it directly affects the quality of decisions. I also enjoy spotting patterns, even in routine tasks.

**6. How do you prioritize when handling multiple data-related tasks?**

_Sample Answer:_  
I use a simple method: I assess urgency vs. importance, then I break large tasks into smaller steps with clear checkpoints. I keep everything organized with lists or spreadsheets to track progress and avoid missing details.

---

**7. What are your strengths and weaknesses?**

_Sample Answer:_  
My strength is attention to detail — I caught and logged over 15 bugs during my internship by being meticulous during QA testing. My weakness is that I sometimes overthink before asking questions, but I’ve been working on this by being more proactive in clarifying tasks.

**8. How would you explain data analytics to someone non-technical?**

_Sample Answer:_  
I’d say data analytics is like being a detective with numbers. You look at patterns in data to figure out what’s working and what’s not. For example, if you’re running a campaign, analytics can tell you which messages are getting clicks and which ones are being ignored. That helps you improve your next move.

**9. What do you do if you spot inconsistencies or errors in the data?**

_Sample Answer:_  
I would flag the inconsistency, double-check the source if available, and consult with the team to validate if it’s a known issue or if corrections are needed. I believe in documenting issues clearly so they’re easy to track and fix.

**10. Are you open to working in a hybrid or full on-site setup in Cebu?**

_Sample Answer:_
