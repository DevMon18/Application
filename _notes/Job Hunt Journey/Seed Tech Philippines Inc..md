**Interview Questionnaire: Software Quality Assurance Engineer**

---

**1. Tell me about yourself.**

_Suggested Answer:_  
I’m a recent graduate of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from Eastern Visayas State University – Ormoc Campus. During my internship at Fenestra Virtual Solutions, I performed manual QA testing for live web applications, created test cases, and reported bugs, which gave me hands-on experience with real client-facing systems. I also worked on academic projects involving both front-end and back-end development, and I’m eager to grow as an SQA Engineer by applying my skills in documentation, attention to detail, and test execution.

**2. What do you understand by software quality assurance and why is it important?**

_Suggested Answer:_  
Software quality assurance ensures that software products meet the required quality standards before release. It includes activities like test planning, defect tracking, and test execution. It is important because it helps identify bugs early, ensures the product meets user requirements, and prevents costly post-deployment issues.

**3. Describe your experience with QA testing.**

_Suggested Answer:_  
During my internship, I developed and executed manual test cases for a POS-integrated inventory system. I collaborated with developers in reporting and resolving over 15 bugs. I also used Google Sheets to track test cases and outcomes. This hands-on experience helped me understand the test cycle from preparation to defect documentation.

**4. Are you familiar with any bug tracking or testing tools?**

_Suggested Answer:_  
While I haven’t used professional tools like JIRA or TestRail yet, I’m familiar with bug tracking using spreadsheets, and I’m confident I can learn and adapt to tools like these quickly. I also used GitHub for version control in collaborative projects, which aligns with configuration and defect management processes.

**5. Can you explain what a test case is and what it should include?**

_Suggested Answer:_  
A test case is a set of conditions or steps used to determine whether a software feature works as expected. It includes the test case ID, description, preconditions, steps to execute, expected results, and actual results. During my internship, I created detailed test cases to validate system functionalities based on the requirements.

**6. Do you have experience testing web or mobile applications?**

_Suggested Answer:_  
Yes, I tested a web-based POS system during my internship and developed mobile prototypes using Flutter in academic projects. Though I primarily focused on manual testing, I ensured functionality across multiple devices and interfaces.

**7. What would you do if you discover a critical bug the day before a product release?**

_Suggested Answer:_  
I would immediately document the issue, notify the development and project management teams, and assess the impact. If necessary, I’d help reproduce the issue and collaborate on a solution. Clear communication and prioritization are crucial in such cases.

---

**8. Are you familiar with ISTQB or other testing certifications?**

_Suggested Answer:_  
I am familiar with ISTQB as a foundational certification for software testing. While I haven’t obtained it yet, I am interested in pursuing it to deepen my understanding of standardized testing practices.

---

**9. Are you open to learning new testing tools and automation frameworks?**

_Suggested Answer:_  
Absolutely. I’m eager to expand my skills in test automation and configuration management tools. I’ve already explored some scripting in Python and JavaScript, which I believe will help me transition into automated testing.

---

**10. Why do you want to work in QA instead of development?**

_Suggested Answer:_  
I enjoy identifying issues, improving systems, and ensuring quality—QA fits my attention to detail and problem-solving mindset. While I also enjoy development, I find satisfaction in refining and validating software to ensure it’s truly ready for users.
