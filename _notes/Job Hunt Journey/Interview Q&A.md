**Basic Interview Questions (with STAR Method)**

**1. Tell me about yourself.**

**Answer:** **Situation:** Since high school, I’ve always been curious about how technology works, especially software like games and apps. **Task:** I wanted to learn how to build my own programs, but initially, I struggled and even paused college because I thought IT wasn't for me. **Action:** After learning more about the opportunities in the field, I returned to school and fully committed to pursuing a degree in IT. **Result:** I graduated and completed an internship where I learned QA testing and development. Today, I’m motivated to grow further and contribute to a tech-driven team.

**2. What are your strengths?**

**Answer:** **Situation:** During my academic projects and internship, I was often faced with challenges that required troubleshooting and fast adaptation. **Task:** I had to learn new technologies, solve bugs, and work with limited resources. **Action:** I used documentation, practiced independently, and asked guidance from mentors when needed. **Result:** I became confident in debugging, testing, and delivering accurate, detailed work, showing my curiosity, adaptability, and problem-solving mindset.

**3. What is your biggest weakness?**

**Answer:** **Situation:** I used to feel overwhelmed when faced with complex or unfamiliar tasks. **Task:** This often delayed my progress, especially when starting a new tool or feature. **Action:** I learned to break down big problems into smaller tasks and focused on just getting started rather than waiting to feel confident. **Result:** Over time, this helped me become more proactive and better at managing self-doubt. I now view uncertainty as a sign that I’m learning.

**4. Why do you want to work here?**

**Answer:** **Situation:** I’m a fresh graduate looking to grow in a supportive, structured environment. **Task:** My goal is to apply what I know while continuing to improve through real-world experience. **Action:** I researched your company and saw your emphasis on innovation, collaboration, and growth. **Result:** These align perfectly with how I’ve overcome my own challenges in IT and why I believe I can grow with your team.

**5. Where do you see yourself in five years?**

**Answer:** **Situation:** Right now, I’m starting my career and actively building technical and soft skills. **Task:** I want to develop expertise in QA, development, or cybersecurity and add more value to any team I join. **Action:** I plan to earn certifications like ISTQB or Security+, learn from senior peers, and stay updated with the latest tools. **Result:** In five years, I see myself as a mid-level IT professional, mentoring others and contributing to high-impact projects.

**Additional Technical and Reflective Questions**

**6. How do you approach debugging a problem you’ve never encountered before?**

**Answer:** **Situation:** During our internship project, I encountered an asynchronous issue in a frontend interface communicating with a Google Sheets backend. **Task:** The bug was unclear, and it wasn’t something I had seen before. **Action:** I broke the problem down using console logs, isolated the affected logic, read documentation, and searched for patterns in the behavior. **Result:** Eventually, I discovered it was caused by a delayed trigger in the script and worked with our mentor to correct it. I learned to treat unknown bugs as learning opportunities, not obstacles.

**7. Can you give an example of a time you had to work independently on a technical task?**

**Answer:** **Situation:** In one of our academic projects, we had to submit a working CRUD system. **Task:** I was responsible for both the frontend logic and backend PHP scripts. **Action:** I handled it alone—researching, coding, testing, and documenting the entire process. **Result:** My system was functional, and I received good feedback from our instructor. It boosted my confidence in working independently.

**8. What do you do when you get stuck while working on a project?**

**Answer:** **Situation:** I often hit blocks while designing complex forms or troubleshooting backend logic. **Task:** When progress stalled, it affected timelines. **Action:** I first try to understand the problem through logs and code breakdowns. If I still can’t move forward, I document the issue clearly and ask for help from peers or mentors. **Result:** This approach helps me avoid wasting time and keeps the project moving while also learning from others.

**9. How do you balance quality with speed when working on tasks with deadlines?**

**Answer:** **Situation:** During UAT testing, we had a limited timeframe to finish feedback rounds. **Task:** I needed to test thoroughly without delaying the next deployment. **Action:** I prioritized high-impact test cases first, then used checklists to cover less critical scenarios. I flagged anything uncertain quickly to the team. **Result:** We delivered the work on time, and the client gave positive feedback. I learned how to prioritize under pressure.

**10. How do your hobbies influence your approach to problem-solving in tech?**

**Answer:** **Situation:** I’ve been playing chess and online games since high school. **Task:** These hobbies demand foresight, logic, and pattern recognition. **Action:** I apply the same mindset in IT—thinking several steps ahead, analyzing dependencies, and anticipating errors. **Result:** It helps me stay calm under pressure and make thoughtful decisions even when systems get complex.
